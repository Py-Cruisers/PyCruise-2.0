# Prepare Your Projects

## Pitch  

### PyCruise 2.0

The user-friendly desktop app that automates menial desktop tasks and operations.

> What problem or pain point does it solve?  

Automate the process of setting up your developer workflow with python automation. Simply enter a command within your terminal and your customized applications, files, and programs will open automatically. Youâ€™ll be able to go through the terminal and add, delete, or edit whatever applications you want it to automatically open upon terminal command.  

> What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?  

Expanding upon our midterm project, create a stylized and user-friendly desktop application/UIs to make it more accessible. Our original project was centered around a set of terminal commands. However, the average person does not know how to interact with a terminal. Therefore, we will put our functionality into a desktop application that will behave the same way.  

    > Original project: A custom set of terminal commands that allows the user to customize their setup. Upon one terminal command, it will open up a set of applications, files, and/or programs (dependent on user input and preference). Other terminal commands will allow the user to add opening applications and delete opening applications.
